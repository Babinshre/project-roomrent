            <span style="font-weight: bold">We have been operating on the real estate market for years. A few years ago we noticed that in Poland there are no solutions for people who come to study or to work from abroad. Standard rooms and apartments for rent are usually intended for people who have their own equipment. In addition, it is difficult for foreigners to find a safe place for themselves through advertising websites. The beginning of life in a foreign country is often language problems, dishonest agents and other pitfalls.
            That's why Room Rent was created. Room Rent is a network of unique flats and apartments that you can rent in whole or choose one room. We made sure that the apartments were equipped with everything necessary to live, work, study and relax. We took care of the highest quality equipment to make living in the apartment a real pleasure. We have created beautiful, elegant and comfortable places.
            We try to help our residents as much as we can. We want our guests to feel good.
